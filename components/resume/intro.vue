      I am a software developer on a perpetual journey to conquer challenges.
      I thrive on problem-solving and refuse to be confined to a specific box.

    <div>
      My heart lies in the Back-End, where I find my greatest joy in architecting simple yet robust solutions.
      However, my journey extends beyond that. From Front-End to Back-End, DevOps, and everything in between, I'm your go-to developer.

    <div>
      Always proactive, I relish collaborating with developer, product, support and design teams to simplify the execution and to bring the best functionalities and aesthetics into every project.
    </div>
    <div>
      What sets me apart is my motivation driven not by specific technologies, but by the specific that each problem presents.
      My approach is pragmatic, grounded in a commitment to practical and battle tested solutions.
